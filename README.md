## RefSelector

![AppStoreIcon](/assets/MarketPlaceIcon.png)

Because we can create a better Reference / Reference Set Selector for Mendix

## Features

- Set a Reference (single) or Reference Set (multiple) by using a dropdown
  - This is similar to the [default Reference Selector](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/reference-selector/), but not native to the [Reference Set Selector](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/reference-set-selector/)
- Choose a Display value for your reference. Either an attribute or String expression
- Search reference by name
- Improve performance by limiting the number of objects that is shown in the client, automatically refreshing the datasource while searching
- Indicate how many objects can be loaded

## Usage

Place the widget in your page. It will look like a normal reference selector:

If you want to know why you would use it, I recommend checking the [Reference Selector docs](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/reference-selector/) and [Reference Set Selector docs](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/reference-set-selector/)

### Preview

### 1. General

#### 1.1 Reference
- Set your Reference. This can either be a **Reference** (1) or **Reference Set** (*)
- Optionally, set an **onChange** action. This action will be triggered when the reference is changed

#### 1.2 Data
- The **Selectable objects** is a list of objects you can choose from to put in the reference. *Make sure this is the same Entity type as the Reference. (Mendix Studio will also give you a warning if this is not the case)*
- **Max Visible options** will determine how many objects will be shown in the dropdown. If you have a lot to choose from (or objects are loading slow), lower this number to improve performance. Mendix will automatically filter the list when you start searching


### 2. UI

#### 2.1 Title
- Choose the **Title attribute** of the options you want to show in the dropdown. This attribute will also be used to search for objects.
- **Display Title** is an alternative title that can be shown in the dropdown. Do note that the search will still be done on the Title attribute

#### 2.2 Placeholder
- The **Placeholder** text that is shown when no option is selected
- The **Nothing found** text is shown when search results are empty

#### 2.3 Bottom Indicator
- When we load a list of selectable options, it could be that we only load a portion (if the amount of items shown, see General, is lower than the total). If that's the case, we show a bottom indicator in the dropdown that shows `{number shown} / {total}`. You can disable this (*by default it's enabled*)


### 3. Behavior

#### 3.1 On Select
- When an option is selected, the dropdown will close by default on single option selection and stay open on multiple option selection. You can override this behavior by setting the **'Close on Select**' option

#### 3.2 Disabled
- You can disable options from being selected by using the '**Disable option**' expression. This will still show the option in the dropdown, but it will be disabled and cannot be selected.


### 4. Validation
- The widget will handle validation messages coming from the client (for example triggered in a Nanoflow/Microflow)
#### 4.1 Required
- Besides validation messages, it will also adhere to the '**Required**' setting. If this is true, a
  - Single Reference cannot be cleared
  - Reference Set cannot be empty (you cannot deselect the last selected option)

### 5. Common
- This widget has a few common properties that can be found in most widgets:
    - Label
    - Conditional Visibility
    - Conditional Editability
    - Name

## Styling

Most of the styling of this widget is done by the component itself. However, you can override the following classes to change the styling:

```css
.widget-select {}
.widget-select__control {}
.widget-select__control.widget-select__control--menu-is-open {}
.widget-select__value-container {}
.widget-select__value-container--is-multi {}
.widget-select__placeholder {}
.widget-select__input-container {}
.widget-select__input {}
.widget-select__indicators {}
.widget-select__indicator-separator {}
.widget-select__dropdown-indicator {}
.widget-select__clear-indicator {}
.widget-select__menu {}
.widget-select__menu-list {}
.widget-select__menu-list.widget-select__menu-list--is-multi {}
.widget-select__option {}
.widget-select__option.widget-select__option--is-focused {}
.widget-select__checkbox {}
```

Note that most of this targetted styling will probably need `!important` to override the default styling.
